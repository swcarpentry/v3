<h1>Software Carpentry Day 5 (Morning): Makefiles/Automated Builds</h1>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>The goal of these exercises is to introduce you
to the execution model of Makefiles.
</p>

<p>
Type in (cut-and-paste if you want, but you'll learn more by typing it):

<hr>
<pre>
CMD=cut -f 1

myexecutable: main.o linkedlist.o matrix.o
        $(CMD) main.o linkedlist.o matrix.o > myexecutable
        
linkedlist.o:  linkedlist.c linkedlist.h main.h
        $(CMD) linkedlist.c > linkedlist.o
        
matrix.o:  matrix.c matrix.h main.h
        $(CMD) matrix.c > matrix.o
        
main.o:  main.c main.h
        $(CMD) main.c > main.o

test:   
        make myexecutable
        wc ./myexecutable 

clean:
        -rm *.o
        -rm myexecutable

setup:
        touch linkedlist.c linkedlist.h main.h
        touch matrix.c matrix.h main.h
        touch main.c
</pre>
<hr>

<p>
Please try each of the following exercises and answer the following
questions:

<ol>

<li>
Type:
<pre>
make clean
make setup
make
touch main.c
make
</pre>

What actions are taken (aka what output do you see)?
Can you explain why these actions (and no other actions) are taken?
<p></p>
</li>

<li>
Write a new <code>fresh</code> target that does the equivalent of the
<code>clean</code> and <code>setup</code> targets, without repeating
any of their action lines.

Once written, one would type <code>make fresh</code> to use your new target.

<li>
<p>
Time permitting, your TA/Instructor will ask you to write a new
Makefile, to specification.

<p>
For example, write a Makefile to capture the dependencies of
the following graph.  Nodes are files or targets.  Arrows or arcs
are actions.

<p>
If you are familiar with latex, this will look familiar.
<b>However,</b> you can still write the Makefile with executables
like <code>cat</code> or <code>cut</code>, even if you do not
know how to use latex.
