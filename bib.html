</dt><dd>
  Its first sentence says, &quot;This book tells you how to find out
  what's wrong with stuff, quick,&quot; and that's exactly what it does.
  In fifteen (very) short chapters, the author presents nine simple
  rules to help you track down and fix problems in software,
  hardware, or anything else.  His war stories are entertaining
  (although I think one or two are urban myths), and his advice is
  eminently practical.

  Stewart Brand:
  <cite>How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built</cite>.
  Penguin USA,
  1995,
  0140139966.
</dt><dd>
  This beautiful, thought-provoking book starts with the observation
  that most architects spend their time re-working or extending
  existing buildings, rather than creating new ones from scratch. Of
  course, if Brand had written &quot;program&quot; instead of &quot;building&quot;,
  and &quot;programmer&quot; where he'd written &quot;architect&quot;, everything he
  said would have been true of computing as well. A lot of software
  engineering books try to convey the same message about allowing
  for change, but few do it so successfully. By presenting examples
  ranging from the MIT Media Lab to a one-room extension to a house,
  Brand encourages us to see patterns in the way buildings change
  (or, to adopt Brand's metaphor, the way buildings learn from their
  environment and from use). Concurrently, he uses those insights to
  argue that since buildings are always going to be modified, they
  should be designed to accommodate unanticipated change.

</dt><dd>
  Most programmers spend most of their time fixing bugs, porting to
  new platforms, adding new features---in short, changing existing
  code.  If that code is exercised by unit tests, then changes can
  be made quickly and safely; if it isn't, they can't, so your first
  job when you inherit legacy code should be to write some.  That's
  where this book comes in.  What to know three different ways to
  inject a test into a C++ class without changing the code?  They're
  here.  Want to know which classes or methods to focus testing on?
  Read his discussion of pinch points.  Need to break inter-class
  dependencies in Java so that you can test one module without
  having to configure the entire application?  That's in here too,
  along with dozens of other useful bits of information.  Everything
  is illustrated with small examples, all of them clearly explained
  and to the point.  There are lots of simple diagrams, and a short
  glossary; all that's missing is hype.

  A community is more than just a bunch of people.  It's a shared

  This book is an excellent guide to that &quot;how&quot;.  Every page
  offers practical advice; every point is made clearly and
  concisely, and clearly draws upon the author's extensive personal
  experience.  Want to know how to earn commit privileges on a

  Like architects, most programmers spend most of their time
  renovating, rather than creating something completely new on a
  blank sheet of paper. This book presents and analyzes patterns
  that come up again and again when programs are being
  reorganized. Some of these are well-known, such as placing common
  code in a utility method. Others, such as replacing temporary
  objects with queries, or replacing constructors with factory
  methods, are subtler, but no less important. Each entry includes a
  section on motivation, the mechanics of actually carrying out the
  transformation, and an example in Java.

  I really wish someone had given me something like this book when I
  took my first programming job. If nothing else, it would have been
  a better way to start thinking about the profession I had stumbled
  into than the &quot;everybody knows&quot; factoids that I soaked up at
  coffee time. Some of what he says is well-known: good programmers
  are up to N times better than bad ones (his value for N is 28),
  reusable components are three times harder to build than
  non-reusable ones, and so on. Other facts aren't part of the
  zeitgeist, though they should be. For example, most of us know
  that maintenance consumes 40-80% of software costs, but did you
  know that roughly 60% of that is enhancements, rather than bug
  fixes? Or that if more than 20-25% of a component has to be
  modified, it is more efficient to re-write it from scratch? Best
  of all, Glass backs up every statement he makes with copious
  references to the primary literature; if you still disagree with
  him, you'd better be sure you have as much evidence for your point
  of view as he has for his.

  This book looks at how to handle several common protocols,

  problems one step at a time, explaining each addition or
  modification along the way. He occasionally assumes more
  background knowledge than most readers of this book are likely to
  have, but only occasionally, and makes up for it by providing both
  clear code, and clear explanations of why this particular function
  has to do things in a particular order, or why that one really
  ought to be multithreaded.

  This book is about those things that make up the difference
  between typing in code that compiles, and writing software that
  reliably does what it's supposed to. Topics range from gathering
  requirements through design, to the mechanics of coding, testing,
  and delivering a finished product. The second section, for
  example, covers &quot;The Evils of Duplication&quot;, &quot;Orthogonality&quot;,
  &quot;Reversibility&quot;, &quot;Tracer Bullets&quot;, &quot;Prototypes and Post-It
  Notes&quot;, and &quot;Domain Languages&quot;, and illuminates each with

  This book describes a project at Carnegie-Mellon University that
  tried to figure out why so few women become programmers, and what
  can be done to correct the imbalance.  Its first six chapters
  describe the many small ways in which we are all, male and female,
  are conditioned to believe that computers are &quot;boy's things&quot;.
  Sometimes it's as simple as putting the computer in the boy's
  room, because &quot;he's the one who uses it most&quot;.  Later on, the
  &quot;who needs a social life?&quot;  atmosphere of undergraduate computer
  labs drives many women away (and many men, too).  The last two
  chapters describe what the authors have done to remedy the
  situation at high schools and university.  This work proves that
  by being conscious of the many things that turn women off
  computing, and by viewing computer science from different angles,
  we can attract a broader cross-section of society, which can only
  make our discipline a better place to be.  The results are
  impressive: female undergraduate enrolment at CMU rose by more
  than a factor of four during their work, while the proportion of
  women dropping out decreased significantly.

  If you're involved in open source software in any way, shape, or

  free/open source software, then discusses what various popular
  licenses actually mean.  The book closes with chapters on topics
  such as how to choose a license, litigation, and standards.  The
  writing is clear---exceptionally so by legal standards---and he
  takes time to explain terms and assumptions that most software
  developers won't have encountered before.  What's more, he doesn't
  seem to have any particular axes to grind: the book is US-centric,
  but his treatment of the various options open to today's
  developers is very even-handed.

  The book's preface says it best: &quot;The reading of code is likely
  to be one of the most common activities of a computing
  professional, yet it is seldom taught as a subject or formally
  used as a method for learning how to design and program.&quot;
  Spinellis isn't the first person to make this point, but he is the
  first person I know of to do something about it.  In this book, he
  walks through hundreds of examples of C, C++, Java, and Perl,
  drawn from dozens of Open Source projects such as Apache, NetBSD,
  and Cocoon.  Each example illustrates a point about how programs
  are actually built.  How do people represent multi-dimensional
  tables in C?  How do people avoid nonreentrant code in signal
  handlers?  How do they create packages in Java?  How can you
  recognize that a data structure is a graph?  A hashtable?  That it
  might contain a race condition? And on, and on, real-world issue
  after real-world issue, each one analyzed and cross-referenced.
  There's also a section on additional documentation sources, and a
  chapter on tools that can help you make sense of whatever you've
  just inherited.

  Every day, all around the world, programmers have to recycle
  legacy data, translate from one vendor's proprietary format into
  another's, check that configuration files are internally
  consistent, and search through web logs to see how many people
  have downloaded the latest release of their product. It may not be
  glamorous, but knowing how to do it efficiently is essential to
  being a good programmer. This book describes the most useful data
  crunching techniques, explains when you should use them, and shows
  how they will make your life easier.

  This well-written, copiously-illustrated book from the creator of
  DDD (a graphical front end for the GNU debugger) is a survey of
  current and next-generation debugging tools.  Some are old
  friends, like bug trackers and symbolic debuggers.  Others are
  new: there's a detailed look at the pros and cons of replay
  debugging, an automatic divide-and-conquer tool that can strip
  test cases down to their essentials, and a whole chapter on how
  dependency analysis and program slicing can be used to isolate
  faults.  If, ten years from now, debuggers have taken a
  much-needed leap forward, much of the credit will go to this book.
